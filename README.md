# About

This is a small little project I worked on that converts a web cam stream to ASCII character art in a terminal. It is not my best work as this was my first time working with Curses and OpenCV, 
but it was fun playing around with these things. I still have a lot to learn and I am not 100% happy with the result but I still think that the result looks pretty good. I may return to this to make it better in the future.
The visual quality could definitely be improved and there is some stuttering I've noticed that occurs sometimes. 

## Usage

Simply run ```python3 main.py``` in your terminal

Quit the program with Ctrl + C.
